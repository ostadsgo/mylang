// variables
// There are two types of variables 
// mutable varaibles that you can change after initialize it
// imutable variable that you can't change after initializing it.
// by defualt variables are imutable

int num = 10;  // a imutable variable
int num;       // default value for int is 0

// I don't know what to do in this case; the defualt value should be void, undefined, null or what?
// do we need this feature?
int | string a_value;  // num can be an integer or an string defualt value is `unkown` is this case

// if you don't know the type of the variable and you still want an imutable variable you use `let` keyword
let a_value;

// if you don't want specify the type and relay on the compiler type detection you need to initialize the variable
let age = 33;

// you can still use type with `let` keyword but isn't required.
let int num;   // int is 0 by default.

// Most the time we know the type or we know the initial value so for these two are most used and best practice
// I know the type
int num;  // let num = 0;
// I know the value
let name = "John Doe"  // let string name = "John Doe" or string name = "John Doe"
// I know the type and value
let bool is_he_cool = true;  // bool is_he_cool = true;

// if you know type or the value alwayse relay to compiler type dection feature and use let don't specify the type

let num = 0;
let msg = "Hello";
let is_he_cool = true;

// var
// is exacly like let but you can change the value after defention of it.
// we alwayse use var keyword to define a variable
var age = 33;
age = 42;

// you can specify type of variable if you like too
var int age = 33;
age += 1;
print(age); // 34
