I know why python use lambda keyword instead of => function
I think => symbol is kinda cool and sexy but it can be conbersom and unreadable
comparing `lambda` keyword

example:
map((x, y) => x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]);
map(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1])

I didn't figure out if a tuple defined by `var` that's mean it is immutable meaning 
can we extend it? so it is become list, but tuple can have name it will make it differ from list.

Range
I can use syntax like 1..10 to create exclusive range meaning the 10 in the example will show up in the 
where it supposed to show up.
it is hard and unreadable to create range of thing with `..` symbol doing reverse step makes it hard 
and limited so I didn't decide to put it in the syntax list
but it can be use something like this
'a'..'z'
and from this example I know the the range should be exculsive beacuse who knows what char comes from after
'z' to make the 'z' included.
alternitive syntax can be look like
'a':'z' it is look like dict I don't like it
I think I will stay from python in this one
