* tuples are immutable by nature and as it's nature is it should be stay immutable meaning don't we have ability to extend it.
if tuple has a name the syntax t.name is nice but if it doesn't have name I think t.0, t.1 is not nice and it is not compitable with list indexing. t[name] t[index] looks fine but not well I don't know what to do

* Sometimes I think to create a programming language without any keywork, I want to make it all functions.
is it possiable, yes of course it  is possiable but I don't know exactly how many advantages that type
of language had

* for commenting I may need to use # and #[ ]#

For systemic stuf like pointer and address of we can use pointer() address() functions and avoid using * , &
